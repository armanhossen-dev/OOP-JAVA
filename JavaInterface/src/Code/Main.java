		///in interface we can create variables and method 
		///but we can't create body {} for them, just declaration for methods
//**!!! the method while override in the subclass we have to make those method public
		///the interfaces methods are like abstract method ,
		/// we have to override them and define them what will they do
		/// also the Override methods will be public returnType methodName(Parameters if they are){...}
